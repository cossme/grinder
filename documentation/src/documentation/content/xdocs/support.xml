    <title>Mailing lists</title>
    <p>Requests for help should be sent to <a
    href="ext:mail/grinder-use">grinder-use@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

    <note>To reduce spam, <strong>you must
    <a href="ext:sourceforge/grinder-mail">subscribe</a>
    to a list before you can send email to it</strong>. The email address you
    send mail from must be the one you used to subscribe.
    </note>

    <p><a
    href="ext:mail/grinder-announce">grinder-announce@lists.sourceforge.net</a>
    is a low-volume mailing list which is used to announce new
    releases and other items of interest to users of The Grinder.</p>

    <p>Please <a href="site:contributing">contribute bug fixes and
    enhancements</a> to <a
    href="ext:mail/grinder-development">grinder-development@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

    <p>You can <a href="ext:sourceforge/grinder-mail">subscribe
    and unsubscribe</a> to the lists, and search their archives, through <a
    href="ext:sourceforge/grinder">SourceForge.net</a>. <a
    href="ext:gmane/grinder-lists">Gmane</a> provides alternative
    searchable archives, together with NNTP feeds and an optional
    Blog-like interface.</p>


    <p>When Philip Aston finds the time to respond to mail about The
    Grinder, <strong>messages not copied to one of the above mail lists
    are likely to be ignored</strong>. Philip freely copies responses to the
    lists; if there is a particular reason why you want to keep your
    communication private you must say so. Finally, if you can provide answers
    to questions sent to the lists, please don't be shy!</p>

    <note>The Grinder is free software. No one is under any obligation
    to fix your problem. If all else fails, you have the
    source.</note>
